This is code is an assignment for the Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data course by Duke University on coursera platform.
For running this code, use blue jay platform as it contains edu.duke library which is very much needed for its execution.
And also please note that I'm a very lazy person so you'll need to create a object and call each function separately for getting the quiz answers. dw you can call the functions easily by just clicking on the created object. Enjoy!
